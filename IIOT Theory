QUESTIONS:
IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)
IIoT refers to connecting industrial devices and machinery to the internet to enable data collection, monitoring, automation, and analysis, improving efficiency, safety, and productivity in industrial settings.

Life Cycle of IIoT
The IIoT lifecycle includes planning (defining goals and needs), deployment (installing devices and systems), operation (data collection and real-time monitoring), maintenance (predictive maintenance based on data insights), and upgradation (adding new capabilities or scaling).

Architecture of IIoT
IIoT architecture typically includes edge devices (sensors and actuators), data processing at the edge, connectivity layers (wireless or wired networks), data aggregation and cloud platforms for analysis, and applications for visualization and control.

History of IIoT
IIoT evolved from traditional automation and industrial control systems, becoming popular with advancements in the internet, wireless connectivity, and low-cost sensors, which allowed devices to connect, communicate, and enable smarter industrial solutions.

Types of Sensors
Common IIoT sensors include temperature sensors (e.g., DHT25), pressure sensors, humidity sensors, proximity sensors, and motion sensors, used to gather real-time data from industrial processes.

Types of Actuators
Actuators convert signals into physical actions; types include electric actuators (motors), hydraulic actuators, pneumatic actuators, and thermal actuators, used to control machinery or processes.

WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks) and Its Types
WSNs are networks of wirelessly connected sensors that monitor environmental conditions. Types include static WSNs, mobile WSNs, underground WSNs, and underwater WSNs, each suited for different applications.

Protocols of WSN
Common WSN protocols include Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN, and LoRaWAN, enabling reliable, low-power communication between nodes.

Zigbee, Z-Wave, Router, Gateway, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Modem, Bridge
Zigbee: Low-power, short-range wireless communication protocol for IoT.
Z-Wave: Similar to Zigbee but mainly for home automation.
Router: Device that routes data packets between networks.
Gateway: Translates protocols between networks, connecting different systems.
Bluetooth: Short-range wireless communication for connecting devices.
Wi-Fi: High-speed wireless internet connectivity for devices.
Modem: Converts digital data to analog for internet access via phone lines.
Bridge: Connects two or more network segments, making them function as one.
Difference Between Gateway and Router
A gateway connects different networks and translates protocols, while a router connects devices within the same network and directs data packets between them.

IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet, on-demand.
Need of Cloud in IIoT
Cloud computing provides scalable storage, powerful data analytics, and remote accessibility, essential for handling and processing the vast amounts of data generated by IIoT devices.

Analog and Digital Sensors
Analog Sensors: Produce continuous signals, e.g., temperature sensor LM35.
Digital Sensors: Produce discrete signals, e.g., temperature sensor DHT11.
MQTT, CoAP, FTP, SMTP
MQTT: Lightweight messaging protocol for IoT, suitable for low-bandwidth devices.
CoAP: Protocol for constrained devices, optimized for low-power, lossy networks.
FTP: Protocol for transferring files over the internet.
SMTP: Protocol for sending emails over the internet.
